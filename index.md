# Project Title
BookThinkers Life-Changing Books - Book Lovers Community Application

## Background
## Who is BookThinkers?
BookThinkers is an education-media company that cultivates a large community of book enthusiasts and authors. BookThinkers help authors promote their books by interviewing them on the BookThinkers podcast. BookThinkers helps expose avid-readers to great new books through the BookThinkers Instagram (111,000 followers). 

## What Are We Building For Them? (Project Goals)
### Overall (By The End of The Semester)
Deliver an intuitive web-app and native iOS App equipped to serve three core functions for book lovers.
1. Maintain a personal bookshelf. Track the books you've read and enter reviews and notes about key learnings from the book.
2. Socialize with other booklovers. Add friends. Follow book influencers. Follow their activity.
3. Create a reminder based retention system to periodicially notify you to reread your book notes to assist with long-term retention.

Implement the necessary functions for administration of the application. 
1. Create an administrative dashboard for the BookThinkers team to view and manage user data and basic analytics
2. Implement a payment solution to facilitate premium subscriptions to the application.

### Sprint 1 (Build the backend)
1. Model our data and build an interactive database for the web and mobile application.
2. Set up our hosting services.
3. Familiarize ourselves with the tools we will be working with. 
4. Set up iOS views for authentication (sign in with Google or manually create an account via email)

### Sprint 1 Goals
1. Build the backend (database and APIs)

## Why This Project?
The BookThinkers team receives extremely frequent and repetitive inbound requests through their Instagram account asking for the solution we hope to provide. Many users want ideas for how to retain their learnings from the books they read. Many also indicate a desire to connect with other book lovers as they don't have real world friends who share their interest in books. 

Additionally, BookThinkers has conducted a few surveys of their audience and the features described in the goal section were the most commonly requested.


# Our Approach
## Backend
We are implementing the backend with a combination of different services provided by Firebase. This primarily includes their Realtime Database and Hosting solutions.

## iOS App
The native iOS App will be built with the Swift programming language. In addition, we will use a few frameworks including Firebase SDK, UIKit, and SwiftUI. For dependency management, we will use Cocoapods.

## Web Application and Company Administrative Dashboard
The website will be built using HTML, CSS, SCSS, Node.js, Angular.js, and Typescript.

# User Experiences
As briefly described in the goals section, this app provides three main benefits to users.
