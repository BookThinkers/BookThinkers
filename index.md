# Project Title
BookThinkers Life-Changing Books - Book Lovers Community Application

## Background
### Who is BookThinkers?
BookThinkers is an education-media company that cultivates a large community of book enthusiasts and authors. BookThinkers help authors promote their books by interviewing them on the BookThinkers podcast. BookThinkers helps expose avid-readers to great new books through the BookThinkers Instagram (111,000 followers). You can read more about them [here](https://www.bookthinkers.com/). 

# Project Goals
## What Did We Aim To Build?
### Overall
Deliver an intuitive web-app and native iOS App equipped to serve four core functions for book lovers.
1. Maintain a personal bookshelf. Track the books you've read and enter reviews and notes about key learnings from each book.
2. Socialize with other booklovers. Add friends. Follow book influencers and read their activity.
3. Create a reminder based retention system to periodicially notify you to reread your book notes to assist with long-term retention.
4. Gamify the app with badges.

Implement the necessary functions for administration of the application. 
1. Create an administrative dashboard for the BookThinkers team to view and manage user data.
2. Implement a payment solution to facilitate premium subscriptions to the application.

## Why This Project?
The BookThinkers team receives extremely frequent and repetitive inbound requests through their Instagram account asking for the solution we hope to provide. Many users want ideas for how to retain their learnings from the books they read. Many also indicate a desire to connect with other book lovers as they don't have real world friends who share their interest in books. 

Additionally, BookThinkers has conducted a few surveys of their audience and the features described in the goal section were the most commonly requested.


# Our Approach

1. Tool selection and tool research. 
2. Self-education in the tools we are be working with. 
3. Model our data and build an interactive database for the web and mobile application.
4. Set up our hosting services.
5. Set up views (Web & Mobile) for authentication (sign in with Google or manually create an account via email).

### Sprint 2 Goals (Prototype the frontend)
1. Set up views for bookshelf (Web and Mobile)
2. Set up views for user profiles (Web and Mobile)
3. Set up views for book summaries and notes (Web and Mobile)
4. Create activity feed (Web and Mobile)
5. Tool Research Selection for Admin Panel
6. Begin Prototyping the Admin Panel

### Sprint 3 Goals (Finish and polish the frontend, Finish Admin Panel)
1. Address technical debt from Sprint 2
2. Implement reminders (Web and Mobile)
3. Implement badges (Web and Mobile)
4. Add additional sign-in authorization options (Web and Mobile)
5. Add payment integration with Stripe (Web and Mobile)
6. Add BookThinkers podcast to activity feed (Web and Mobile)
7. Finish up basic Admin Panel features

# Tools/ APIs/ Frameworks
## Backend
We implemented the backend with Firebase's Realtime Database and Hosting solutions. For the books database, we used Google's Book API.

## iOS App
The native iOS App was built with the Swift programming language. In addition, we used a few frameworks including Firebase SDK, UIKit, and SwiftUI. For dependency management, we used Cocoapods.

## Web Application
The website was built using HTML, CSS, SCSS, Node.js, Angular.js, and Typescript.

## Admin Panel
The admin panel was built with Retool and Javascript.

# User Experiences
As briefly described in the goals section, this app provides four main benefits to users.

### Improving Learning Outcomes (Goals 1 and 3)
The BookThinkers app allows readers to consolidate their biggest takeaways from the physical, digital and audiobooks that they are reading. For example, a BookThinkers Instagram follower may join the app/website using their gmail account. They may have finished reading _Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman._ This book is incredibly densely packed with powerful ideas. Using our app, the user would log that they read the book and add it to their virtual bookshelf. In addition, they would be prompted to leave notes on what they learned from reading the book. Finally, the user would be asked how often they want to be reminded to revisit those notes (Web only). Based on their response, the website will reintroduce notes at specific time intervals to maximize retention using notifications. There will be different â€œpathways" depending on the frequency that each reader is open to. This spaced repetition technique is used by the world's most effective learners to help facilitate the process of learning.

### Creating A Social Community (Goal 2)
When a user logs in, their home screen is a social activity feed where they can see what their friends (other users of the app) are reading. In addition, users can search for other members of the community, follow them, and view their bookshelves.

### Gamification (Goal 4)
The users (Web only) are able to view the badges that they have earned from reading a series of books prescribed by the BookThinkers team.

### Administration Functions
The BookThinkers staff can log into a simple website that provides control of the database for key functions. This can be used for changing user metadata, creating new users, and creating the parameters for acquiring badges.
